The program use fingerprint to help visually blind people to traverse through the laptops.
Every finger has an encoding, which maps to a particular sequence.
Like 1. Thumb represents going inside the folder
	 2. Index finger going to the next folder in the same directory sequencially.
Can be integrated with text to speech systems to provide better user interface for visually blind individuals.
	 
The way this will work is that the finger print scanner will record users fingerprint (Synaptics fingerprint scanner), which will be located  in Sequence1 folder.
The image would then be classified using K Nearest Neighbor, after getting the unique encoding we can use this for traversing folders in laptops or mobile devices..
